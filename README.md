# STIMA Machine Learning Reading Group
The reading group is open to anyone who is interested in machine learning and who wants to meet up regularly to discuss ML research papers.
If you want to get added to the mailing list or have any other questions feel free to contact [Joel Oskarsson](https://liu.se/en/employee/joeos82).

**The reading group will resume in 2023. This page is being updated.**

## Format
* One person is randomly designated the host for each session. They are responsible for choosing the paper to be discussed and for leading the discussion during the session. The host does not need to know the paper better than everyone else and does not need to prepare any presentation for the session.
* We meet Wednesdays 10:15-12:00 on odd weeks.
* We will meet in Thomas Bayes, B-building ([map](https://www.ida.liu.se/department/location/search.en.shtml?keyword=thomas+bayes)).

## Host intstructions
* Choose a paper that you think would be interesting to discuss in the reading group. In order to set a focus for the reading group we came up with the following short guidelines for how to choose papers:
  * The main topic of the paper should be core machine learning research. Try to avoid papers that just apply well known machine learning methods to specific application areas.
  * Make sure the paper is of high quality. Read through it yourself and try to gauge its quality. As a guideline, think that it should be publishable at a top machine learning conference (i.e. the paper should be of such quality, it does not have to actually be a short conference paper).
  * If you want a second opinion on whether a paper is suitable feel free to ask anyone who has been in the reading group previous years.
* Send out a link to the paper on the mailing list at least one week in advance.
* As the host it is also good to somewhat lead the discussion during the session. If you want you can give a short description of why you chose this paper, but there is no need for any proper presentation. It might be a good idea to come to the session prepared with a few discussion points, just to keep the conversation going.
